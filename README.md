# shopping-list

A to-do list for [epirecipes](http://epirecip.es).

## How it works

If you have, or have found, a model that you would like considered for inclusion in `epirecipes`, please [file an issue](https://github.com/epirecipes/shopping-list/issues).

Please add:
- An informative title
- Link to manuscript if available
- Inline code or a link to existing code
- Add [labels](https://github.com/epirecipes/shopping-list/labels) to the issue as appropriate

Also, please check that the requested model isn't a duplicate of one already logged. If time allows, please include LaTeX of any equations/transitions in the system or for models where this isn't appropriate, pseudocode.
